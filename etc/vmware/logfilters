# To filter out excessive logging, add lines with the following syntax:
#
#      numLogs | ident | logRegexp
#
# Any log line with a substring matching the regular expression logRegexp
# will appear the first "numLogs" times that it's issued, but will be
# ignored after that point. For example, the line:
#
#      5 | vmkernel | .*
#
#  will ensure that only the first 5 vmkernel-related lines appear in the log
#  and others are ignored.
#
#  All comparisons are case-sensitive. logRegexp must be a valid regular
#  expression confirming to the Python regular expression syntax.
#  Using '*' for the ident field implies that log messages from all sources
#  are a potential match. Multiple ident values can be specified in a comma
#  separated list. Consult /etc/vmsyslog.conf.d/*.conf for possible values
#  of ident.
#
#  This feature should be used only in the case where a log statement is
#  spewing excessively. Filtering the log too aggressively may make
#  troubleshooting more difficult if it loses valuable information.
