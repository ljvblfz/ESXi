 * jumpstart script (see vxlan.json).
 *
 * This is done to allow restore-networking to require 'vxlan' and still fulfill
 * it's requirements when the vxlan VIB is not installed. When VXLAN is configured
 * the modules should be loaded before networking is restored, and jumpstart
 * doesn't allow for expressing a dependency on running before some other plugin,
 * just which plugins must be run before it.
