#
# This file contains a list of power sensors that are known to VMware, Inc.
#
# OEMs: to add support for new machines, do not modify this file
# directly, but place a new file in this directory instead.
#
# Supported format:
#
#   EntryType:SensorType:Manufacturer:Product:Sensor1[,Sensor2...]:Units
#
# EntryType must be "default", SensorType must be "power", and Units
# must be "WATTS" (all without quotation marks).
#
# Manufacturer and Product are compared against the system's SMBIOS
# (also known as DMI) information from its System Information (Type 1)
# record.  Manufacturer and Product are both case-insensitive and will
# match even if the actual name is longer; for example, "Dell" would
# match "DELL, INC.".  Product may be "*" to match all products from
# the specified Manufacturer.
#
# Sensor names are case-sensitive and must match exactly.  If multiple
# sensor names are listed on a line, and/or the system has multiple
# sensors with the listed name(s), sensord reads them all, sums them,
# and reports the total as the system power.  It is acceptable for not
# all of the sensors listed on a line to be present; sensord will skip
# any that are missing as long as at least one is present.
#
# Lines are considered one by one, in order.  If a line's Manufacturer
# and Product match and at least one listed Sensor is present on the
# system, that line is used and sensord does not read any further
# lines.  If not, sensord proceeds to the next line.  If multiple
# files exist in this directory, the order the files are read in is
# unspecified.
