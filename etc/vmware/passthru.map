# file format: vendor-id device-id resetMethod fptShareable
# vendor/device id: xxxx (in hex) (ffff can be used for wildchar match)
# reset methods: flr, d3d0, link, bridge, default
# fptShareable: true/default, false
#
# Description:
#
# - fptShareable: when set to true means the PCI device can be shared.
#   Sharing refers to using multiple functions of a multi‐function
#   device in different contexts. That is, sharing between two
#   virtual machines or between a virtual machine and VMkernel.
#
# - resetMethod: override for the type of reset to apply to a PCI device.
#   Bus reset and link reset prevent functions in a multi-function
#   device from being assigned to different virtual machines, or from
#   being assigned between the VMkernel and virtual machines. In
#   some devices it's possible to use PCI power management capability
#   D3->D0 transitions to reset the device. In the absence of the
#   override, the VMkernel decides the type of PCI reset to apply
#   based on the device's capabilities. The VMkernel prioritizes
#   function level reset (flr).
#
# Restrictions:
#
# - PCI SR-IOV physical and virtual functions (PFs/VFs) are not allowed
#   in the list below. Those must support function-level-reset and
#   must be shareable.
